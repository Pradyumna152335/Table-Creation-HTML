**Project Title: Interactive Conference Schedule Web Page**

**Project Description:**

The Interactive Conference Schedule Web Page project aims to create a user-friendly and visually appealing web page that displays the schedule for an upcoming conference. This web page will utilize HTML and its components such as the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, `<span>`, and `<colspan>` tags to organize the conference schedule. Additionally, an overview of CSS will be used to style the page, including the `<h1>` tag and the application of classes to enhance the design and layout.

**Features:**

1. **Responsive Schedule Table:** The heart of the web page will be a well-structured schedule table created using HTML `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` tags. The schedule table will include columns for Time, Session Title, Speaker, and Room Number.

2. **Time Slot Grouping:** Utilizing the `<colspan>` attribute, time slots that span multiple consecutive sessions can be grouped together for better readability. This provides a visual representation of the duration of each time block.

3. **Session Details:** Each session in the schedule will be represented by a row in the table. The Session Title, Speaker Name, and Room Number will be displayed in corresponding columns. The `<span>` tag can be used to highlight important session details.

4. **Styling with CSS:** The page's visual appeal will be enhanced using CSS. The `<h1>` tag will be utilized for the title of the web page. External CSS stylesheets will be linked to apply consistent and aesthetically pleasing styling to the entire page.

5. **Class Usage:** CSS classes will be created to target specific elements within the HTML structure. For example, different classes can be applied to session rows, time slots, and table headers to differentiate their appearance. This allows for easy customization and maintenance of the design.

6. **Hover Effects:** CSS can be employed to create subtle hover effects on session rows, providing a visual cue when users interact with the schedule. This enhances the user experience and makes the page more interactive.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **HTML Structure:** Set up the basic HTML structure of the web page, including the header, body, and schedule table using appropriate HTML tags.

2. **Table Design:** Create the conference schedule using `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, and `<th>` tags. Utilize `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes to group time slots and span multiple columns when needed.

3. **CSS Styling:** Develop an external CSS stylesheet to apply styles to various elements. Define classes for session rows, time slots, and headers. Apply CSS properties such as font styles, colors, padding, and margin to achieve a polished look.

4. **Class Application:** Apply the defined CSS classes to the relevant HTML elements to ensure consistent styling throughout the page.

5. **Hover Effects:** Implement CSS hover effects to enhance user interaction. For instance, change the background color or add a subtle shadow to session rows when users hover over them.

6. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the web page across different browsers and devices to ensure responsiveness and consistent styling. Make necessary adjustments to improve the user experience and fix any issues.

7. **Documentation:** Provide clear comments within the HTML and CSS code for better understanding and future maintenance.

**Conclusion:**

The Interactive Conference Schedule Web Page project combines the use of HTML, including the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, `<span>`, and `<colspan>` tags, with CSS styling and classes to create an attractive and functional schedule display for an upcoming conference. The result is a user-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing web page that effectively communicates the conference schedule to attendees.
